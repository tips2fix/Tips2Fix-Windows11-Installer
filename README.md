# Tips2Fix Windows 11 25H2 Installer 🚀

A simple script to install **Windows 11 25H2** on unsupported PCs.  
Created by **Tips2Fix** in collaboration with ChatGPT.

## Features
- Fast install (no registry edits)
- Advanced install (auto-bypass TPM, Secure Boot, RAM, CPU checks)
- Reset mode (restore registry keys to default)
- Live progress bar while copying ISO files
- Final subscribe message 😉

## How to use
1. Download the repo and unzip.
2. Double-click `Run-Installer.bat` (it will run as Administrator).
3. Select your Windows 11 25H2 ISO.
4. Choose install mode:
   - Fast
   - Advanced (recommended for unsupported PCs)
   - Reset (remove bypass keys)
5. The script copies ISO → Desktop, applies registry bypass if chosen, and launches the Windows installer.

## Requirements
- Windows 10 or higher
- PowerShell 5.1+
- Administrator rights

## Notes
- This script is not officially supported by Microsoft.
- Use at your own risk. Always back up your files first.
- Unsupported installs may not receive all updates.


## What the script does not do
❌ Does not download or modify your ISO.
❌ Does not install drivers or change bootloaders.
❌ Does not collect data or phone home.
❌ Does not force install — you still control Windows Setup.


🛡️ Antivirus Note

Some antivirus programs may flag this tool as a virus or trojan, but that’s a false positive ⚠️.
Why? Because the installer is a PowerShell script inside a .bat wrapper, and antiviruses sometimes flag scripts that interact with setup files.

👉 Rest assured, it’s 100% safe. If your AV blocks it, just temporarily disable protection or add an exclusion.
